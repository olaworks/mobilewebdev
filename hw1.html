        <h1> My Journey As a Mobile Web Developer </h1>
         <h2> A little about me .. </h2>
         <h3> My journey in development, started in design. Always a creative person, I love visual aesthetic. My favorite colors are those of green, blues- teals and dark aquas. I absolutely love the beach. I love nature and all things pleasant and beautiful. I love peace and quiet. But I also love adventure, excitement- but no scary movies please!</h3>
         <h2> Why Take a Course in Mobile Development .. </h2>
         <h3> Because I love CNIT! In addition, I'm working on completing a certification at the College. I'm interested to see how the formatting for different screens will pan out. Having a website formatted to fit mobile devices/screens is important- because the screens look nice and appealing to the person interacting with the web file.</h3>
